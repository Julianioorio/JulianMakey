                    <h6>Depending on the input, this can result in using a lot of processing power and time. The whole
                        process would take approximately 5 seconds to return a result to the client. Keep in mind we're
                        talking about 1 item, a contact from a contact book. After a while, a new requirement is added.
                        Solution must support companies that manage their contacts organized in files. We agreed to
                        develop a web application that would support upload of dataset files, like .csv. The new web
                        application should support third party integrations. Some of them are the ESP/CRM services, like
                        Mailchimp. User does not need to see the result immediately. System can later notify the user
                        about the result, when the process finishes. This information is the key that we need to
                        leverage on when developing our solution. So here's how we did it.</h6>
                    <h3>Initial approach</h3>
                    <h6>Our initial approach went like this: The web application would read a .csv file line-by-line and
                        submit an array of entries to the backend REST API. Processing is in real time, immediately
                        after the user makes a request for the process to start, he expects a result. Another approach
                        is to apply vertical scaling to AWS architecture. Meaning we used larger, more expensive
                        instances that have more RAM and processing power. This system worked well for smaller datasets,
                        maybe up to 5k entries, but for larger datasets multiple problems arose. This solution is prone
                        to failure due to long request time. Also, because of some 3rd party services that aren't
                        optimized for large scale loads or they don't have batch endpoints. 3rd party services also tend
                        to protect their architecture from making a huge bill on their end. The whole process was done
                        in real-time. The request can take a lot of time hanging in there while the backend would do all
                        the work and return the result to the client. The request was limited to 300 seconds (at time of
                        writing the article) before AWS would cancel itâ€¦ Also I need to mention that the user has to
                        wait a few minutes to see the results. They can't use the app during the process, which makes
                        for a bad user experience.</h6>
